<h2>Large Scale Market Segmentation</h2>
# Electric Vehicle Market Segmentation Study

## Abstract and Objective:
The goal of the study is to segment the EV market based on psychographic, behavioral, and socio-economic characteristics to identify potential buyer groups.

- **Segments Identified:**
  - Conservatives
  - Indifferents
  - Enthusiasts

Various statistical and analytical methods like cluster analysis, multiple discriminant analysis, and Chi-square tests were used to validate the segmentation.

## Market Segmentation:

- **Behavioral Segmentation:** Focuses on usage patterns, brand loyalty, and benefits sought.
- **Psychographic Segmentation:** Based on values, attitudes, personality traits, and activities.
- **Socio-Demographic Segmentation:** Includes age, gender, income, and education.

## Data Collection:
Data was collected manually from various sources:
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- [Data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/)
- [World Bank Datasets](https://data.worldbank.org/)

## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Used to reduce the dataset's dimensionality and simplify the analysis.

## Market Growth:
Electric vehicle sales have increased significantly in India over the past decade, with a focus on charging infrastructure.

## Segmentation Methods:

- **Dendrogram:** Used in hierarchical clustering to visualize the structure and determine optimal clusters.
- **Elbow Method:** Applied to determine the number of clusters by evaluating the distortion score for different values of k.

## Clustering Algorithms:

- **K-Means Algorithm:** Used to identify homogeneous subgroups (clusters) within the dataset by minimizing intra-cluster variance.
